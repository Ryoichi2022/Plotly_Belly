Challenge 12
## Plotly_Belly project description

### Based on a hypothesis that the ideal bacterial species for synthetic beef may be in humanâ€™s navel, samples are collected from the navels of people across the country. Through the Plotly_Belly project, a dashboard will be developed so that researchers can view the summary of the information such as the basic data of the participants, the top bacterial species in their navels, and the frequency of navel wash. The website is expected to be also accessed by the research participants.
