Challenge 12
## Plotly_Belly project description

### Based on a hypothesis that the ideal bacterial species for synthetic beef may be in humanâ€™s navel, samples are collected from the navels of people across the country. A dashboard will be developed so that researchers can obtain the information such as the basic information of the participants, the top bacterial species in their navels and the frequency of navel wash. The website is expected to be accessed by the research participants.
